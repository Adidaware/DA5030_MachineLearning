## Analysis of Wines

The data analyzed consists of various attributes of `r n.rows` wines. There are `r alc.content` wines with an alcohol content above 12%. The highest alcohol content of any wine is `r highest.alc`. `r qual` wines have an alcohol content above 12% and a quality rating below 6.

We define "swill index" as the ratio of alcohol divided by quality and multiplied by the residual sugar content. The five wines with the largest swill index are listed below:
